# Puppet ENC using MongoDB

This originally started as a fork of bcarpio/mongodb-enc, however it has turned in to a complete re-write.  The only thing that has been kept is the basic schema.  Since the two code bases no longer share any code in common, I decided to break off the fork and create an entirely new project with a new name.

## Documentation

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/drwahl/yape/wiki). 


## Project Status

This project is still in *Beta*. This means at any given time the code is under active development.  A majority of the features for a 1.0 release are in place and I'm fairly happy with the current schema.  If you are using this code and would like to make feature requests please do so in the issue tracker.
